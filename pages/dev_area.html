            In this blogpost I'll show how the first version of the crop system and some of first items, that we're made looked.<br>
            When the crop system first was made, the resource pack wasn't done yet. So the textures weren't loaded yet. The Crops<br>
            looked like stone and had a text over them so you could identifie which crop it was. The items hadn't had the correct<br>
            color for their rarity. The only spells that were already in the game were four healing spells. And the wands weren't<br>
            even implemented yet. Relics were also not implemented yet.
